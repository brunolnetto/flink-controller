## Environment Consistency

### Cross-Platform Setup
All assets are designed to work consistently across:
- **Linux**: Native support
- **macOS**: Homebrew installation
- **Windows/WSL2**: WSL2 environment
- **Docker**: Containerized development

### Justfile as Primary Interface
The `justfile` serves as the primary interface for all development tasks, ensuring:
- **Consistent Commands**: Same commands work everywhere
- **Reduced Friction**: Minimal setup required
- **Automated Workflows**: Complex tasks simplified
- **Progressive Quality**: Built-in quality gates

### Environment Variables
Standardized environment setup through:
- `.env` file for local development
- CI/CD environment variables
- Docker environment configuration

## Usage Instructions

### For New Developers
1. **Clone Repository**: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. **Install Just**: Follow platform-specific instructions
3. **Setup Environment**: `just setup`
4. **Start Development**: `just dev`

### For Existing Developers
1. **Update Dependencies**: `just setup`
2. **Check Status**: `just status`
3. **Run Tests**: `just test`
4. **Quality Check**: `just check`

### For CI/CD Pipelines
The Justfile commands are designed to work in automated environments:
```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: just test
- name: Quality check
  run: just check
- name: Security scan
  run: just security
```

## Asset Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- **Weekly**: Update milestone tracker
- **Per Release**: Update roadmap and policies
- **Per Feature**: Update workflow documentation
- **Per Environment**: Update setup instructions

### Version Control
- All assets are version controlled
- Changes require review and approval
- Breaking changes require migration guides
- Documentation updates accompany code changes

## Quality Assurance

### Asset Validation
- **Justfile**: Tested across all platforms
- **Documentation**: Reviewed for accuracy
- **Dependencies**: Security scanned
- **Workflows**: Validated in CI/CD

### Consistency Checks
- **Cross-Platform**: Tested on Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Dependency Management**: Consistent versions
- **Command Interface**: Unified through Justfile
- **Quality Gates**: Progressive through development phases

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Justfile Commands**: Use `just --list` to see available commands
- **Environment Setup**: Use `just status` to check configuration
- **Dependencies**: Use `just setup` to refresh
- **Quality Issues**: Use `just fix` to resolve

### Platform-Specific
- **Windows/WSL2**: Ensure WSL2 is properly configured
- **macOS**: Use Homebrew for package management
- **Linux**: Use system package manager
- **Docker**: Use provided Dockerfile.dev
