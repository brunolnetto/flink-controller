# Flink Job Controller ‚Äî Implementation Policies & Development Standards

This document defines the implementation policies, coding standards, and development practices for building the production-ready Flink Job Controller.

---

## üß™ Test-Driven Development (TDD) Policy

### TDD Workflow
1. **Red**: Write a failing test that defines the desired behavior
2. **Green**: Write the minimum code to make the test pass
3. **Refactor**: Clean up the code while keeping tests green

### Test-First Requirements
- **All new features** must start with a failing test
- **All bug fixes** must include a test that reproduces the bug
- **All refactoring** must maintain existing test coverage
- **No production code** without corresponding tests

### Test Coverage Standards
```yaml
# Minimum coverage requirements
unit_tests: 90%
integration_tests: 80%
security_tests: 100%
critical_paths: 100%

# Coverage exclusions
exclude:
  - "*/__init__.py"
  - "*/main.py"
  - "*/config/*"
  - "*/scripts/*"
```

### Test Structure
```python
# Example test structure following TDD
class TestJobDeployer:
    """Test suite for JobDeployer class."""
    
    def setup_method(self):
        """Setup test fixtures."""
        self.deployer = JobDeployer()
        self.mock_flink_client = Mock()
        self.deployer.flink_client = self.mock_flink_client
    
    def test_deploy_job_success(self):
        """Test successful job deployment."""
        # Arrange
        spec = JobSpec(job_id="test-123", artifact_path="test.jar")
        self.mock_flink_client.deploy.return_value = DeployResult(status="success")
        
        # Act
        result = self.deployer.deploy_job(spec)
        
        # Assert
        assert result.status == "success"
        self.mock_flink_client.deploy.assert_called_once_with(spec)
    
    def test_deploy_job_failure_handling(self):
        """Test job deployment failure handling."""
        # Arrange
        spec = JobSpec(job_id="test-123", artifact_path="test.jar")
        self.mock_flink_client.deploy.side_effect = FlinkClusterUnavailable()
        
        # Act & Assert
        with pytest.raises(DeploymentError):
            self.deployer.deploy_job(spec)
```

## üìù Coding Standards & Style Guide

### Python Style Guide
- **PEP 8** compliance with Black code formatter
- **Type hints** required for all function signatures
- **Docstrings** required for all public methods and classes
- **Maximum line length**: 88 characters (Black default)

### Code Quality Tools
```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ['py311']

[tool.isort]
profile = "black"
multi_line_output = 3

[tool.flake8]
max-line-length = 88
extend-ignore = ["E203", "W503"]

[tool.mypy]
python_version = "3.11"
strict = true
warn_return_any = true
warn_unused_configs = true
```

### Naming Conventions
```python
# Classes: PascalCase
class JobSpecManager:
    pass

# Functions and variables: snake_case
def deploy_job(job_spec: JobSpec) -> DeployResult:
    pass

# Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
MAX_RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3
DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS = 30

# Private methods: _leading_underscore
def _validate_spec(self, spec: dict) -> bool:
    pass

# Protected methods: __double_underscore (name mangling)
def __internal_method(self):
    pass
```

### Documentation Standards
```python
class JobDeployer:
    """Handles Flink job deployment with comprehensive error handling.
    
    This class provides a robust interface for deploying Flink jobs to clusters,
    including proper error handling, retry logic, and rollback capabilities.
    
    Attributes:
        flink_client: The Flink REST API client instance
        retry_manager: Manager for retry logic and backoff strategies
        circuit_breaker: Circuit breaker for external service calls
        
    Example:
        >>> deployer = JobDeployer()
        >>> result = deployer.deploy_job(job_spec)
        >>> print(f"Deployment status: {result.status}")
    """
    
    def deploy_job(self, spec: JobSpec) -> DeployResult:
        """Deploy a Flink job with comprehensive error handling.
        
        Args:
            spec: The job specification containing deployment parameters
            
        Returns:
            DeployResult: Result object containing deployment status and metadata
            
        Raises:
            DeploymentError: When job deployment fails after all retries
            ValidationError: When job specification is invalid
            AuthenticationError: When Flink cluster authentication fails
            
        Example:
            >>> spec = JobSpec(job_id="etl-001", artifact_path="jobs/etl.jar")
            >>> result = deployer.deploy_job(spec)
            >>> if result.status == "success":
            ...     print(f"Job deployed with ID: {result.job_id}")
        """
        pass
```

## üîí Security Implementation Policy

### Security-First Development
- **All code changes** must pass security review
- **No hardcoded secrets** in source code
- **Input validation** required for all external inputs
- **Principle of least privilege** for all operations

### Security Checklist
```yaml
# Pre-commit security checks
security_checks:
  - "No hardcoded credentials"
  - "Input validation implemented"
  - "SQL injection prevention"
  - "XSS prevention (if applicable)"
  - "CSRF protection (if applicable)"
  - "Secure communication (TLS/SSL)"
  - "Proper error handling (no information leakage)"
  - "Access control implemented"
  - "Audit logging enabled"
  - "Dependency vulnerability scan passed"
```

### Secure Coding Practices
```python
# ‚ùå BAD: Hardcoded credentials
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __init__(self):
        self.password = "secret123"  # Never do this!

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Environment-based credentials
class DatabaseConnection:
    def __init__(self):
        self.password = os.getenv("DB_PASSWORD")
        if not self.password:
            raise ConfigurationError("DB_PASSWORD environment variable required")

# ‚ùå BAD: No input validation
def deploy_job(job_spec: dict):
    subprocess.run(f"flink run {job_spec['artifact_path']}")

# ‚úÖ GOOD: Input validation and sanitization
def deploy_job(job_spec: dict):
    validated_spec = JobSpecValidator.validate(job_spec)
    sanitized_path = Path(validated_spec.artifact_path).resolve()
    if not sanitized_path.exists():
        raise ValidationError(f"Artifact not found: {sanitized_path}")
    subprocess.run(["flink", "run", str(sanitized_path)])
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Design Principles

### SOLID Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Derived classes must be substitutable
- **Interface Segregation**: Many specific interfaces over one general
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Design Patterns
```python
# Strategy Pattern for different deployment strategies
class DeploymentStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def deploy(self, spec: JobSpec) -> DeployResult:
        pass

class JarDeploymentStrategy(DeploymentStrategy):
    def deploy(self, spec: JobSpec) -> DeployResult:
        # JAR deployment logic
        pass

class PyFlinkDeploymentStrategy(DeploymentStrategy):
    def deploy(self, spec: JobSpec) -> DeployResult:
        # PyFlink deployment logic
        pass

# Factory Pattern for creating deployment strategies
class DeploymentStrategyFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_strategy(job_type: str) -> DeploymentStrategy:
        if job_type == "jar":
            return JarDeploymentStrategy()
        elif job_type == "pyflink":
            return PyFlinkDeploymentStrategy()
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unsupported job type: {job_type}")
```

### Error Handling Strategy
```python
# Custom exception hierarchy
class FlinkControllerError(Exception):
    """Base exception for all Flink controller errors."""
    pass

class DeploymentError(FlinkControllerError):
    """Raised when job deployment fails."""
    pass

class ValidationError(FlinkControllerError):
    """Raised when job specification validation fails."""
    pass

class AuthenticationError(FlinkControllerError):
    """Raised when authentication fails."""
    pass

# Error handling decorator
def handle_flink_errors(func):
    """Decorator to handle Flink-specific errors."""
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        try:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        except requests.RequestException as e:
            logger.error("Network error during Flink operation", exc_info=e)
            raise FlinkControllerError(f"Network error: {e}")
        except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
            logger.error("Invalid JSON response from Flink API", exc_info=e)
            raise FlinkControllerError(f"Invalid API response: {e}")
        except Exception as e:
            logger.error("Unexpected error during Flink operation", exc_info=e)
            raise FlinkControllerError(f"Unexpected error: {e}")
    return wrapper
```

## üìä Code Review Standards

### Review Checklist
```yaml
# Code review requirements
review_checklist:
  functionality:
    - "Does the code implement the intended feature?"
    - "Are edge cases handled properly?"
    - "Is error handling comprehensive?"
    - "Are performance implications considered?"
    
  security:
    - "Are there any security vulnerabilities?"
    - "Is input validation implemented?"
    - "Are secrets handled securely?"
    - "Is authentication/authorization implemented?"
    
  code_quality:
    - "Is the code readable and maintainable?"
    - "Are naming conventions followed?"
    - "Is documentation adequate?"
    - "Are type hints used correctly?"
    
  testing:
    - "Are unit tests comprehensive?"
    - "Are integration tests included?"
    - "Is test coverage adequate?"
    - "Are tests meaningful and not just for coverage?"
    
  architecture:
    - "Does the code follow established patterns?"
    - "Are dependencies properly managed?"
    - "Is the code modular and reusable?"
    - "Are SOLID principles followed?"
```

### Review Process
1. **Automated Checks**: All automated checks must pass
2. **Peer Review**: At least one peer review required
3. **Security Review**: Security-sensitive changes require security review
4. **Architecture Review**: Major architectural changes require architecture review

---

## üöÄ Deployment & Release Policy

### Release Process
```yaml
# Release workflow
release_process:
  1. "Feature freeze and code freeze"
  2. "Comprehensive testing (unit, integration, security)"
  3. "Performance testing and load testing"
  4. "Security audit and vulnerability scan"
  5. "Documentation review and update"
  6. "Release candidate creation"
  7. "Staging environment deployment"
  8. "Production deployment with rollback plan"
  9. "Post-deployment monitoring and validation"
```

### Versioning Strategy
```python
# Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
# MAJOR: Breaking changes
# MINOR: New features, backward compatible
# PATCH: Bug fixes, backward compatible

# Example version progression
# 1.0.0 - Initial release
# 1.1.0 - Add batch job support
# 1.1.1 - Fix deployment timeout issue
# 2.0.0 - Breaking change in API
```

### Deployment Safety
```yaml
# Deployment safety measures
deployment_safety:
  - "Blue-green deployment strategy"
  - "Rollback capability within 5 minutes"
  - "Health check validation before traffic switch"
  - "Gradual rollout (canary deployment)"
  - "Comprehensive monitoring during deployment"
  - "Automated rollback on health check failures"
```

```yaml
# Performance benchmarks
performance_requirements:
  job_deployment:
    p50_latency: "< 10 seconds"
    p95_latency: "< 30 seconds"
    p99_latency: "< 60 seconds"
    
  reconciliation_loop:
    cycle_time: "< 30 seconds"
    max_concurrent_jobs: "1000+"
    
  api_response_time:
    p50_latency: "< 100ms"
    p95_latency: "< 500ms"
    p99_latency: "< 1 second"
```

### Scalability Guidelines
```python
# Resource management
class ResourceManager:
    """Manages resource allocation and limits."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.max_concurrent_deployments = 10
        self.max_memory_per_job = "4g"
        self.max_cpu_per_job = 2
        
    def can_deploy_job(self, spec: JobSpec) -> bool:
        """Check if resources are available for job deployment."""
        current_deployments = self.get_active_deployments()
        return len(current_deployments) < self.max_concurrent_deployments
```

## üîç Monitoring & Observability Standards

### Logging Standards
```python
# Structured logging with correlation IDs
import structlog
import uuid

logger = structlog.get_logger()

def log_with_context(func):
    """Decorator to add correlation ID to all log entries."""
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        correlation_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        with structlog.contextvars.bound_contextvars(correlation_id=correlation_id):
            logger.info("function_started", function=func.__name__)
            try:
                result = func(*args, **kwargs)
                logger.info("function_completed", function=func.__name__, status="success")
                return result
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error("function_failed", function=func.__name__, error=str(e), exc_info=True)
                raise
    return wrapper
```

### Metrics Collection
```python
# Prometheus metrics
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram, Gauge

# Define metrics
job_deployments_total = Counter('flink_job_deployments_total', 'Total job deployments', ['status', 'job_type'])
job_deployment_duration = Histogram('flink_job_deployment_duration_seconds', 'Job deployment duration')
active_jobs = Gauge('flink_active_jobs', 'Number of active jobs', ['job_type'])

# Use metrics in code
def deploy_job(spec: JobSpec) -> DeployResult:
    start_time = time.time()
    try:
        result = _perform_deployment(spec)
        job_deployments_total.labels(status="success", job_type=spec.job_type).inc()
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        job_deployments_total.labels(status="failed", job_type=spec.job_type).inc()
        raise
    finally:
        duration = time.time() - start_time
        job_deployment_duration.observe(duration)
```
