### 8. `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
**Purpose**: Automated quality gates and testing reminders
**Usage**:
- Pre-commit hooks installation
- Automated code formatting
- Security scanning
- Testing reminders

**Key Hooks**:
- Code formatting (black, isort)
- Linting (flake8, mypy)
- Security scanning (bandit, detect-secrets)
- Testing reminders (integration, contract, security)

## Environment Consistency

### Cross-Platform Setup
All assets are designed to work consistently across:
- **Linux**: Native support
- **macOS**: Homebrew installation
- **Windows/WSL2**: WSL2 environment
- **Docker**: Containerized development

### Justfile as Primary Interface
The `justfile` serves as the primary interface for all development tasks, ensuring:
- **Consistent Commands**: Same commands work everywhere
- **Reduced Friction**: Minimal setup required
- **Automated Workflows**: Complex tasks simplified
- **Quality Enforcement**: Built-in quality gates

### Environment Variables
Standardized environment setup through:
- `.env` file for local development
- CI/CD environment variables
- Docker environment configuration

## Usage Instructions

### For New Developers
1. **Clone Repository**: `git clone <repo-url>`
2. **Install Just**: Follow platform-specific instructions
3. **Setup Environment**: `just install-dev`
4. **Install Hooks**: `just pre-commit-install`
5. **Start Development**: `just feature <name>`

### For Existing Developers
1. **Update Dependencies**: `just install-dev`
2. **Check Status**: `just status`
3. **Run Tests**: `just test-all`
4. **Quality Check**: `just quality-check`

### For CI/CD Pipelines
The Justfile commands are designed to work in automated environments:
```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: just test-coverage
- name: Quality check
  run: just quality-check
- name: Security scan
  run: just security-scan
```

## Asset Maintenance

### Regular Updates
- **Weekly**: Update milestone tracker
- **Per Release**: Update roadmap and policies
- **Per Feature**: Update workflow documentation
- **Per Environment**: Update setup instructions

### Version Control
- All assets are version controlled
- Changes require review and approval
- Breaking changes require migration guides
- Documentation updates accompany code changes

## Quality Assurance

### Asset Validation
- **Justfile**: Tested across all platforms
- **Documentation**: Reviewed for accuracy
- **Dependencies**: Security scanned
- **Workflows**: Validated in CI/CD

### Consistency Checks
- **Cross-Platform**: Tested on Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Dependency Management**: Consistent versions
- **Command Interface**: Unified through Justfile
- **Quality Gates**: Enforced through pre-commit

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Justfile Commands**: Use `just --list` to see available commands
- **Environment Setup**: Use `just status` to check configuration
- **Dependencies**: Use `just install-dev` to refresh
- **Quality Issues**: Use `just quality-fix` to resolve

### Platform-Specific
- **Windows/WSL2**: Ensure WSL2 is properly configured
- **macOS**: Use Homebrew for package management
- **Linux**: Use system package manager
- **Docker**: Use provided Dockerfile.dev

This asset structure ensures that developers have a consistent, high-quality experience regardless of their environment while maintaining our production-ready standards and reality-based testing approach.
